# Text-Doc-Semantic-Similarity
Text/Doc Semantic Similarity Check

This project involves the development and implementation of a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) to assess the semantic similarity between texts/documents. Over 3000 text pairs were used alongside their similarity values. Advanced preprocessing techniques were applied to ensure clean and meaningful inputs.

To enhance word vectorization in the SNN, Stanford's GloVe 6B word vectors were utilized. By engineering and fine-tuning the SNN with Keras modules, an impressive accuracy of 90.4% was achieved, leading to a remarkable 32.23% decrease in model loss.

The primary goal is to evaluate the semantic similarity between texts/documents, enabling efficient text comparison in various applications.
